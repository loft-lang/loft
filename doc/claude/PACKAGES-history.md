# PACKAGES-history.md — the timeline behind PACKAGES.md

The timeline behind [PACKAGES.md](PACKAGES.md): the original implementation-phase plan.

---

## Implementation phases

| Phase | Scope | Effort | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | Connect `#native` to interpreter dispatch | Medium | `extensions.rs` completion |
| **P2** | `loft install` for local packages | Medium | P1 |
| **P3** | Native codegen `--extern` for `#native` packages | Medium | P1 |
| **P4** | WASM codegen with native package wasm rlib | Medium | P3 |
| **P5** | OpenGL package: 2D canvas + PNG | Medium | P1 |
| **P6** | OpenGL package: font rendering | Small | P5 |
| **P7** | OpenGL package: GL window + shader | High | P5 + glutin |
| **P8** | WebGL variant + WASM integration | High | P4 + P7 |

P1 is the foundation — without interpreter dispatch of `#native` symbols,
nothing else works.  P5-P6 can proceed in parallel with P3-P4 since the
2D canvas and font rendering don't need GL.
